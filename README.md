# CAMA
CAMA (Amateur Competition in Mathematics and Algorithms) is an initiative aimed at promoting these competitions worldwide, but especially in Spain and our environment. Our initiative is led by high school students, including various international medallists in these disciplines, who are passionate about mathematics and programming. We believe in the power of these disciplines to foster logical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.
In CAMA, we not only organize challenging competitions but also commit to providing learning opportunities for students, both newcomers and experienced in mathematics and programming. We believe that everyone has the potential to learn and improve in these areas.
